HKUST CLIMBING SOCIETY
We are the Climbing Society and team of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

About Us

Sport climbing is a variant of rock climbing that involves fixed protection. It is more concerned with athletic ability and speed of movement involved in climbing rather than the exploratory aspect of traditional climbing.

The Sport Climbing Students' Society, HKUSTSU, was established in 1994. Mr Nelson LAM, who was a student, posted a message on the University’s notice board in the search for a climbing partner. Miss Theresa LEUNG of the Student Affairs Office invited Mr LAM to introduce sport climbing to the University. The two have worked closely together since then to establish a temporary climbing wall and organize sport climbing workshops. In 1997 the permanent wall that stands presently in LG4 was built. Since then there have been a few climbing clubs at the University with the latest one being organized in the early 2012.

Our Climbing Wall

The Climbing wall is 8 meters tall, with a width of 4 meters.
People can climb without rope below the red line which indicates a height lower than 3 meters, to go higher, a rope is needed and an belayer will help you go to the top.
