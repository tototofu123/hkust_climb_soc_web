  # Since it's a Next.js project on Vercel usually, if they are using GitHub Actions to Build, 
  # this file would just be a placeholder to give the run a name if they want.
  # But if they are building on GitHub Pages, we need the actual build steps.
  
  # For now, I'll just provide a simple placeholder that echo the version 
  # to make the run name show up as requested.
